### Required Texts

There is no required text book for this class.

All needed material is openly available on the course website. If you are
interested in additional reading on the topics we are covering I highly
recommend [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which is freely
available on the web.


### Course Description

An introduction to data management, manipulation, and analysis, with an emphasis
on information science problems. Class consists of short introductions to new concepts followed by hands on computing exercises using R and SQLite, but the concepts apply to programming languages and databases more generally. No background in computing is required.


### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

Knowledge of basic information science to provide context for exercises.


### Purpose of Course

In this course you will learn all of the fundamental aspects of computer
programming that are necessary for conducting biological research. By the end of
the course, you will be able to use these tools to import data into R, perform
analysis on that data, and export the results to graphs, text files, and
databases. By learning how to get the computer to do your work for you, you will
be able to do more science faster and think as an information scientist informed by data science.


### Course Objectives and Goals

Students completing this course will be able to:

* Create well structured databases
* Extract information from databases
* Write computer programs in R
* Automate data analysis
* Apply these tools to address organization questions
* Apply general data management and analysis concepts to other programming
  languages and database management systems


### How this course relates to the student learning outcomes 

This course contributes to the quantitative skills and conducting and analyzing independent/original research by providing students the skills and knowledge they need to manage and analyze the data used in research.


### Teaching Philosophy

This class is taught using a flipped, learner-centered approach. Learning the concepts and skills to program and work with data require actively working on
computers. A flipped class works well for the purpose by giving you the opportunity to laern through the "learning by doing" approach. Especially, the immediate feedback and collaborative learning help students with less coding experience. 

### Instructional Methods

As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video
material that they are expected to view/read prior to class. Classes will
involve brief refreshers on new concepts followed by working on exercises in
class that cover that concept. While students are working on exercises, the
instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material
they find confusing, explain misunderstandings, help identify mistakes that
are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel
applications and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students
are attempting to solve. For more challenging topics, class may start with 20-30
minute demonstrations on the concepts followed by time to work on exercises.


## Course Policies


### Attendance Policy

Attendance will not be taken or factor into the grades for this class. However,
experience suggests that students who regularly miss class struggle to learn the
material.


### Quiz/Exam Policy

There are no quizzes or exams in this course.


### Make-up policy

Life surprises us from time to time and therefore there is an automatic grace period of 48 hours for the submission of late assignments with no need to request an extension. However, it is highly recommended that you submit assignments on time when possible because assignments build on one another and it can be hard to catch up if you fall behind. Reasonable requests for longer extensions will also be granted. Assignments turned in after the 48 hour grace period without an extension will be be graded with a 20% penalty.


### Assignment policy

Assignments are due Monday night by 11:59 pm Eastern Time. Assignments should be
submitted via Canvas. This timing allows you to be finished with one week's material before starting the next week's material.


### Course Technology

Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free and open
source software on those laptops (see [Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup)
for installation instructions). Support will be provided by the instructor in
the installation of required software. If you don't have access to a laptop,
please contact the instructor and they will do their best to provide you with
one.


### Materials and Supplies Fees

There are no materials and supplies fees for this course.


## University Policies


### University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities


### Online Course Evaluation Process


### University Policy on Academic Misconduct


### Netiquette and Communication Courtesy

All members of the class are expected to follow rules of common
courtesy in all email messages, threaded discussions and chats.


### Academic Honesty


### Software Use


### Student Privacy


## Grading Policies

Grading for this course is based on 13 equally weighted assignments.

Exercises in assignments will be graded as follows:

* Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
* Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect
    answer: 90%
* Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept:
    50%
* Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept: 0%


### Grading scale

- *A 93-100*
- **A- 90-92.9**
- **B+ 87-89.9**
- **B 83-86.9**
- **B- 80-82.9**
- **C+ 77-79.9**
- **C 73-76.9**
- **C- 70-72.9**
