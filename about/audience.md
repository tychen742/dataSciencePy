The long-term goal of this site is to help two large groups of people:
<<<<<<< HEAD
1) Students in a classroom at a college or university; and 
2) Free-range learners, or folks who aren't taking a formal class and are interested
in learning online on their own time. 

We are starting with the classroom students and then attempting to build on the material generated to make

it maximally useful to the broader audience of learners of information technology who want to learn how to use programming and database management systems. We are interested in helping folks who are complete beginners and those who already have some programming background.

Examples of folks who we are trying to help:

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Leah** An undergraduate student who thinks learning about coding and data analysis is more fun than the other available electives. She has never programmed before and doesn't really know what a database is.

**Kai:** An undergraduate student in an information science and technology-related field who has taken some IT courses and realizes that data science skills are going to be important in whatever area of computational technology he ends up working or likes computers. 

**Emily:** A graduate student with a background in doing hands on
biology. Now that she's in graduate school, she's realized that managing the data she's collecting in a reasonable way is going to be important (working with the hodge podge of poorly structured spreadsheets that her lab uses is awful), and doing all of the analysis that she needs to conduct for her dissertation seems like it would be a lot easier if it could be automated.

**Anthony:** A faculty member with little computer background who realizes
that computing has become so central to his area of research that he
needs to at least have a rough idea of how his students are working the
magic they do for projects with a lot of programming. Even better, he'd
like to get to the point where he can really engage and help out.
