### Welcome

* Introduce yourself
* Introduce co-instructors/TAs
* Depending on class size have students introduce themselves

### Course goals

* Data and how to work with it
* Data entry -> Data storage -> Data manipulation -> Data visualization
* Not statistics

### Teaching methods

* Flipped classroom
    * You don't learn how ride a bike just by listening to someone talk about it
      and the same is true for computing
* Reading or videos before class
* I do, we do, you do
    * I will demo an idea using live coding
	* We will work on an associated exercise together in class
	* You will work on additional exercises on your own (both in & out of class)
* Peer instruction
    * Interact with each other during the we do and you do parts
	* You are at least as likely to learn from your peers as from me
    * If you already know some of the material and are getting ahead, see if
      there's someone you can help
	* Introduce yourself to one of your neighbors you don't know

### Course structure

* Weekly assignments
    * Practice is really important for learning skills like this
    * Work on exercises in class
	* Will require additional programming time after class
	* Due end of the day on Monday
